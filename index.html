    Closet Archives explores second-hand clothing as a way of memory, imagination, and connection rather than simply a piece of clothing. I am interested in how clothes move through different lives and how meaning may change as they are worn and passed on to new owners.

    The survey asks people to reflect on their second-hand piece of clothing. Instead of asking for factual information or memories, it asks for personal interpretation, for example, who might have worn it, and if it has been mended.

    Closet Archives shows how second-hand clothing can connect strangers, and by presenting survey responses in one shared space, extends this connection through collective reflection and storytelling.
